Most functions will crash if passed a default-constructed mystring
Always use the lib functions to do standard things...I gave you a reference to the strcmp function in the assignment.  
The problem is that people reading your code will waste time figuring out what you are doing...they will be frustrated to  
find that your code does exactly what strcmp will do. Using strcmp would make operator== literally one line of code
